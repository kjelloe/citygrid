# City Grid — development log

*The real history of the project, newest last. Every slice gets an entry naming what was
**measured**, not what was intended, and every dead end is written down with its measurement so it
is never re-walked. Planning entries are here too — the reasoning behind a plan rots faster than
the plan itself.*

## 2026-08-25 — Planning: the singleplayer plan (P1)

Read `specs/gamedesign.md` (a complete singleplayer design), `specs/referencedata.md` (a
behavioural analysis of a classic open-source city simulator), and the two stack write-ups in
`../Retrogradegames/`.

Wrote `specs/plan.md` rev 1. The load-bearing decisions: a pure deterministic reducer with integer
state and the PRNG inside the state; no build step; three.js with instanced meshes; state hash as
the single contract; numbers in JSON, never in code.

Two things in `referencedata.md` were deliberately **not** ported:

- Its traffic router is a 30-step random walk with an undefined-variable bug; route-finding is
  effectively broken. Replaced by a monthly capacity-aware integer Dijkstra over sampled
  origin–destination pairs.
- Its constants were tuned for a 120×100 map, a different demand model and no multiplayer. They
  enter as `era 0, untuned` starting points only (later ruled: 007).

Licence posture set: `referencedata.md` is a specification to compare against, never a source.
City Grid ships MIT.

## 2026-08-25 — Planning: multiplayer (P2)

Requirements arrived: fully client-side singleplayer, a lobby, drop-in for up to sixteen players,
**no direct destruction of another player's work**, an optional exclusive-sector mode, several
modes.

Rev 2 of `specs/plan.md`. The decision that shaped everything after it: **ownership is hashed
engine state and permission checks live in the reducer**, not the UI. A tile carries an `owner`,
and `engine/permissions.js` gates every command. Retrofitting that later is how permission bugs are
born, so it moves into the first placement slice (1.3) rather than a multiplayer wave.

Demolition became a request entity in game state — title, location, reason, optional compensation,
standing policy for absent players — rather than a chat message, so it replays and so an absent
player answers deterministically.

## 2026-08-25 — Planning: server load (P3)

Question was whether to use "the 20 Hz approach" from `../Fireline`.

**Measured, from the source:** Fireline is **10 Hz** — `engine/clock.js`, `TICKS_PER_SECOND = 10`,
`TICK_MS = 100`. Its profile (`reports/2026-08-06_resource_profile.md`) shows the per-player cost
is per-socket snapshot serialization, ~0.35% of a core and ~0.5–1 MB RSS each, and that views are
built per team specifically to hold that down.

Conclusion: adopt the cadence and its instrumentation, **not the payload**. Fireline streams
snapshots because dozens of units move every tick and clients interpolate. City Grid has no
authoritative motion — its vehicles are a sampled representation of traffic density, which every
client can generate locally — so frames carry accepted commands, one serialization per pump serves
every socket, and server cost is flat in player count. The inverse of Fireline's scaling.

The load levers that actually matter turned out not to be the tick rate: coalescing drag-paint into
one RLE command (the reference implementation fires a tool event per tile crossed — *that* would
be the overload), degrading the game clock rather than the pump, and hibernating empty rooms.

## 2026-08-25 — Planning: omission review (P4)

Reviewed rev 2 against the design and both reference stacks. Ten gaps, five needing a decision
before code. The two worst were structural:

- **The multiplayer simulation had no semantics.** Ownership was specified in detail but nothing
  said what RCI demand *is* with sixteen players — the core loop. Ruled at 001.
- **No session lifecycle.** Drop-in only makes sense if the world outlives the session, but nothing
  said whether a room ends. Ruled at 002.

Also added: protocol versioning against a cached PWA (after every deploy the *default* case is a
stale client meeting a new server, and a mismatched reducer desyncs silently), a disasters slice,
audio, accessibility, drop-in onboarding, moderation, ops, command-log growth, chaos injection, and
the rule that perf is measured on a saturated city rather than an empty map.

## 2026-08-25 — Planning: design updated, plan-v1 written (P5)

Four rulings taken (001–004). `specs/gamedesign.md` rev 2 adds §25–33 — multiplayer, modes and
lobby, session lifecycle, progression, difficulty, communication, audio, accessibility, onboarding,
content — plus a §33 amendments table so the original design stays readable rather than rewritten
underneath.

`plan-v1.md` written: 7 waves, 27 slices, three release gates, a stop-and-re-plan section.

## 2026-08-25 — Planning: balance provenance and art style (P6)

Rulings 007 (start from reference constants, tune by sweep) and 005/006 (one art style at v1,
chosen by probe; four-angle rotation is a hard requirement).

The useful finding: the three candidate styles are **two pipelines, not three** — pixel art and
isometric 2.5D are the same depth-sorted sprite code at different resolutions. With rotation as a
hard requirement, a drawn-sprite style would need four sprite sets per building state, so v1 is the
mesh pipeline. The pixel-art *look* survives inside it as a post-process — low-resolution render
target, nearest upscale, palette quantisation, dither, outline — keeping rotation, zoom and
procedural asset generation. Slice 1.2b rewritten around three rotation-capable candidates.

## 2026-08-25 — Records and scaffold (P7, and this entry)

`dev-prompts.md` and `dev-questions.md` created — prompts verbatim, questions with their answers,
open questions in a clearly separated bottom section.

Then the project scaffold: `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `dev-log.md`, `specs/art-direction.md`
(framework only — the style itself is blocked on probe 1.2b), `specs/rulings/001–007`, four skills,
and a runnable test harness.

**The harness is the point of this entry.** `./test.sh` runs `node --test` twice and is green
against an empty codebase, and three of its tests are already load-bearing before any engine code
exists:

- `subset.test.js` fails on a `class`, `this`, `Map`, `Set` or `throw` in `engine/` (ruling 004).
- `purity.test.js` fails on `Math.random`, `Date.now`, `new Date`, `setTimeout`, `null` literals or
  float literals in `engine/` and `shared/`.
- `docs.test.js` fails when the open questions in `plan-v1.md` and `dev-questions.md` disagree,
  when a referenced document is missing, when a ruling lacks its required fields, or when
  `dev-prompts.md` has a gap in its numbering.

They pass vacuously today and start biting on the first line of slice 0.2. Writing the guard
before the code is cheaper than retrofitting it after — which is the same lesson as ownership
landing in slice 1.3.

**Next:** slice 0.1 (repo skeleton and static serve) and 0.2 (deterministic primitives with pinned
vectors).
